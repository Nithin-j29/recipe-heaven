          Soak Broken Wheat For 30 Minutes To prepare this popular Hyderabadi
          delicacy, wash and soak the broken wheat or dalia for half an hour.
          Trim the mutton (boneless) of any excess fat. Add the mutton to a
          pressure cooker with about 1 cup water and put it over medium flame.
          Fry the onion until golden brown and set aside.

          Pressure Cook Mutton For 15-20 Minutes To the mutton, add 1/2 tbsp of
          ginger and garlic paste, half a tsp of salt, red chilli powder, half a
          tsp of garam masala powder and a pinch of turmeric powder. Pressure
          cook the mixture for 8-10 mins and simmer for another 15-20 mins.
          Shred and keep aside.

          ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, 2-3 green chillies, and peppercorns in
          8 cups of water until it's cooked completely and the water is
          absorbed. Blend this mix for a few seconds.
